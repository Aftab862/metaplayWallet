                    <p>
                        This Privacy Policy applies solely to the MetaPlay Wallet platform and related services. It
                        does not apply to any anonymized or aggregated data that cannot identify you as an
                        individual.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        the information you entrust to us. However, we do not collect personal data by default,
                        and this Policy reflects our privacy-by-design approach.
                    </p>
